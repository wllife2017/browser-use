"""Per-action timeout regression test.

When a CDP WebSocket goes silent (common failure mode with remote / cloud browsers),
action handlers can await event-bus dispatches that never resolve — individual CDP
calls like Page.navigate() have their own timeouts, but the surrounding event
plumbing does not. Without a per-action cap, `tools.act()` hangs indefinitely and
agents never emit a step, producing empty history traces.

This test replaces `registry.execute_action` with a coroutine that sleeps longer
than the per-action cap, then asserts that `tools.act()` returns within the cap
with an ActionResult(error=...) instead of hanging.
